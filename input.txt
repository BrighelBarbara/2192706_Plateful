# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

Plateful is a platform that allows a group of users to collaboratively organize a menu for social events such as dinners, picnics, or parties. The goal is to create a menu that meets the preferences of every participant, allowing users to upload their recipe ideas along with the respective ingredients and vote for their favorite options in each category (appetizers, main courses, desserts, etc.). With Plateful, users can join or create events, submit dish proposals, vote for the options they prefer and report allergies.
